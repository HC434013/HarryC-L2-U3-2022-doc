# Testing
My portfolio was developed with Microsoft Sway and testing consisted of:
- Checking animation timings and display were correct
- Checking that content formatting was correct

Seeing that the portfolio is just one long page, user interaction is just scrolling and clicking hyperlinks. So testing these elements consists of making sure links go to the right place.

Bugs weren't much of an issue as this was created using Sway.
